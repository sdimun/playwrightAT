# Playwright Task

This task contains end-to-end test for the [Veeam website](https://www.veeam.com/) using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

## Installation

First of all I had to install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
As Playwright requires NodeJS 14+, check if you have already installed NodeJS with command:

```bash
node -v


If you don't have Node.js at all, or you don't have right version, you can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
